## Data Structures

### Queue

A Queue is a collection that maintains elements in a linear order, allowing elements to be added at the end and removed from the front. It follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

### Stack

A Stack is a collection that maintains elements in a linear order, allowing elements to be added and removed from the same end. It follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

### SinglyLinkedList

A SinglyLinkedList is a collection of nodes where each node points to the next node in the list. It allows for efficient insertion and removal of elements from the beginning and end of the list.

### DoublyLinkedList

A DoublyLinkedList is a collection of nodes where each node points to both the next and previous nodes in the list. It allows for efficient insertion and removal of elements from the beginning and end of the list.

### BinaryHeap

A BinaryHeap is a binary tree-based data structure that maintains elements in a partially ordered manner, ensuring that the highest (or lowest) element can be efficiently accessed and removed.
